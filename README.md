# CryptoDonkeyMinersTuningTool

CryptoDonkeyMinersTuningTool will go through the clocks specified and add the results to an easy-to-sort list, to help find the best clocks for your card.

Currently only ERGO with T-Rex miner is supported.

NEW FEATURE:
Added minimum acceptable hashrate and minimum acceptable hashrate retires. When minimum hashrate has been reached (set by you), it will try n times (also set by you) to ensure that it doesnt fall off a cliff after a couple of runs
